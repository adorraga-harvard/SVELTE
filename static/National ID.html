	<h1>Lightning vs. Lightning Bug: A Lesson from the Philippine National ID System</h1>

	<p>
		In nature, lightning and lightning bugs both produce light, but their essence and purpose are vastly different. Lightning is a powerful, natural phenomenon—brief, intense, and unmistakably real. Lightning bugs, on the other hand, emit a gentle glow, a signal that can be beautiful but is ultimately a form of communication, not the force itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		This metaphor aptly describes the current state of the Philippine National ID system. The government has glorified the creation of the National ID card, focusing heavily on the physical card itself rather than the true concept of identity it is supposed to represent. The system encourages the ID card to serve as the primary <strong>identity identifier</strong>, but a closer look reveals a fundamental misunderstanding: the card is not an identity; it is a tool for <strong>authentication</strong>.
	</p>

	<h2>Identity vs. Authentication: Why the Difference Matters</h2>

	<p>
		Identity is who you are—your unique existence, your legal and social recognition. Authentication, however, is the process of verifying that you are who you claim to be. The National ID card, as designed, is packed with personal data: address, birthday, photograph, and even biometric information. This makes it a powerful authentication device, but it does not inherently establish identity on its own.
	</p>

	<p>
		By conflating the card with identity, the system risks reducing a complex, multifaceted concept into a physical token. This token can be lost, stolen, or forged. Worse, it becomes a treasure trove for malicious actors.
	</p>

	<h2>The Problem with the National ID Number: Complexity Over Usability</h2>

	<p>
		The National ID Number is a randomly generated 12-digit number. While randomness ensures uniqueness, it sacrifices memorability. Most people struggle to remember even 7-digit numbers, let alone 12-digit sequences. An effective ID number should strike a balance: it must be unique but also easy enough to memorize or recall.
	</p>

	<p>
		Why complicate something that should be simple? An ID number is not a password; it is a public identifier. It should be designed so that it can be shared or displayed without fear of compromising security. The real security lies in the <strong>secret information</strong> that the ID owner holds—something only they know or possess—that authenticates their claim to that ID.
	</p>

	<h2>Exposing Authentication on the Card: A Critical Flaw</h2>

	<p>
		The Philippine National ID card, however, exposes the owner's authentication system by printing sensitive personal data and biometric information directly on the card. This is akin to handing over the keys to your house along with your address on a silver platter.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because the card contains so much personal and biometric data, it becomes a jackpot for hackers and identity thieves. If lost or stolen, the card can be used to impersonate the owner, commit fraud, or access services fraudulently.
	</p>

	<h2>What Should Have Been Done?</h2>

	<p>
		A truly effective National ID system should separate the concept of identity from the physical card. Identity should be managed securely in a backend system with strict access controls, while the card should serve as a minimal, secure authentication token—nothing more.
	</p>

	<p>
		The ID number should be simple enough to remember and safe to share publicly. Authentication should rely on secret credentials or multi-factor methods that are never exposed on the card itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		Biometric data and sensitive personal information should be protected and only accessed when absolutely necessary, not printed or stored on a card that can be easily lost or stolen.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion: Learning from Nature</h2>

	<p>
		Just as lightning’s power is not in its glow but in its force, identity’s strength lies not in a card but in the secure, trusted systems behind it. The Philippine National ID system, as it stands, is more like a lightning bug—flashing bright but vulnerable and easily exploited.
	</p>

	<p>
		To protect citizens and their identities, the system must evolve beyond glorifying the card and focus on building a secure, privacy-centered identity infrastructure. Only then can it truly shine with the power and reliability that a nation deserves.
