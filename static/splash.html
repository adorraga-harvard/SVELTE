          <div class="section-title">National ID - Smart Fusion</div>
          A transformative idea for digital identity in the Philippines. Unlike previous implementations, this project envisions a fusion of security, privacy, and usability. It doesn’t glorify the card—it builds a secure infrastructure behind it.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Lightning vs. Lightning Bug</div>
          The National ID card has been promoted like a lightning strike—powerful and necessary. But in practice, it acts more like a lightning bug: a flicker without substance. A glowing card is not proof of secure identity—it’s just light.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Identity vs. Authentication</div>
          Identity is who you are. Authentication is how you prove it. The card is a tool for the latter—not the former. By merging the two, the system confuses form with function and compromises both.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Data Exposure Problem</div>
          Personal data and biometrics printed on the card expose citizens to fraud. A card can be copied. Stolen. Exploited. True identity should be managed securely in systems, not printed in your wallet.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">The Number that Fails</div>
          A 12-digit randomized ID number is not practical. It's hard to memorize, hard to share, and needlessly complex. Identity numbers should be simple, public, and safe—like a username, not a secret code.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Smart Fusion: A Better Vision</div>
          Smart Fusion separates identity from token. The card is minimal. The backend is powerful. Authentication happens through private factors, not printed ones.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Biometrics Stay Private</div>
          Biometric data should never be printed or stored on cards. They should be encrypted, device-local, or managed via secure multi-factor methods—always under user control.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">The Modular Identity Model</div>
          This vision splits identity into backend truth and frontend proof. It's resilient, secure, and interoperable. The citizen owns their credentials. The system verifies them without ever exposing them.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative-block">
          <div class="section-title">Conclusion: Let the System Shine</div>
          Just as lightning carries the power, not the glow, true identity systems work quietly but effectively. The Philippines deserves a National ID that is trustworthy, not decorative. Smart Fusion can be that lightning.
