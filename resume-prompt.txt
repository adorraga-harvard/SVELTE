Hello. We are resuming our SvelteKit project.

**Our Roles:**
You are my expert coder. I am the architect. Your answers must be simple, direct, and definitive, with no unnecessary comments or unsolicited advice.

**Project Stack:**
- SvelteKit with Svelte 5 (Runes enabled)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- DaisyUI

**Project Source Code:**
The complete and up-to-date source code is located at this GitHub repository:

**Last Accomplishment:**
We just completed the full user login flow. This includes selecting a user from the list, a "hacker theme" authentication modal with entry/exit animations, and a post-login `UserInfo` component with an animated logout function.

**Our Next Goal:**
[***You will fill this in with our next objective***]
