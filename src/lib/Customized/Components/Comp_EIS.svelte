        <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Executive Information System (EIS)</h2>
        <p>An Executive Information System is a specialized type of IS built for a very specific user: a senior manager or executive. It's a high-level tool designed for strategic decision-making, not daily operations. An EIS pulls data from the underlying IS, but it filters and presents it in a very different way.</p>

        <ul class="mt-10">
            <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Exclusively for executives and senior management.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Supports high-level policy decisions and strategic planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Uses a combination of <strong>internal</strong> data (from the IS) and <strong>external</strong> information.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> An EIS provides a streamlined, often graphical, overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. It lets executives monitor performance, spot problems, and identify opportunities without needing to sift through massive, detailed reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the PDEA, an EIS would be the system the Director General uses. They wouldn't need to see the <code>case_id</code> for every single bust. Instead, their EIS would show a dashboard with a map of the country, highlighting regions with increased drug seizures over the past quarter, or a graph showing the efficiency of different units based on case closures. The EIS would distill the detailed, operational data from the main PDEA Information System and present it in a clean, visual format to help the executive make high-level decisions.</p>
