    <p>A standard <b>Information System (IS)</b> is for daily operations, while an <b>Executive Information System (EIS)</b> is a specialized tool for top-level executives to make strategic decisions.
        <br><br>
        Think of it like a car: an IS is the whole vehicle that gets you from A to B. The EIS is the dashboard, designed to give the driver (the executive) a quick, high-level view of what's happening without getting bogged down in the mechanics.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl">Information System (IS)</h2>
        <p>An Information System is a broad term for any system that collects, processes, stores, and distributes data to support an organization's operations and decision-making. The PDEA system we've discussed is a great example of an IS. It's built for day-to-day use by various personnel, from agents to analysts, to manage a wide range of tasks.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Used by different levels of staff, from the field to administration.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Handles routine, day-to-day operations. It deals with a vast amount of structured and semi-structured data.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Primarily uses internal information, like the data from raids, arrests, and personnel records.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> A standard IS focuses on transactional data and status reporting. It's the engine that keeps the organization running smoothly.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h2 class="text-3xl">Executive Information System (EIS)</h2>
        <p>An Executive Information System is a specialized type of IS built for a very specific user: a senior manager or executive. It's a high-level tool designed for strategic decision-making, not daily operations. An EIS pulls data from the underlying IS, but it filters and presents it in a very different way.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Exclusively for executives and senior management.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Supports high-level policy decisions and strategic planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Uses a combination of <strong>internal</strong> data (from the IS) and <strong>external</strong> information.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> An EIS provides a streamlined, often graphical, overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. It lets executives monitor performance, spot problems, and identify opportunities without needing to sift through massive, detailed reports.</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <p>For the PDEA, an EIS would be the system the Director General uses. They wouldn't need to see the <code>case_id</code> for every single bust. Instead, their EIS would show a dashboard with a map of the country, highlighting regions with increased drug seizures over the past quarter, or a graph showing the efficiency of different units based on case closures. The EIS would distill the detailed, operational data from the main PDEA Information System and present it in a clean, visual format to help the executive make high-level decisions.</p>
